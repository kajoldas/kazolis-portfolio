            <p>Love has been a favored topic of philosophers, poets, writers, and scientists for generations, and
                different
                people and groups have often fought about its definition.

                    My personal definition of a professional developer is a developer who is able to build and maintain
                    a
                    commercial piece of software. In other words, if said developer made or edited software, and that
                    software is generating money for someone somewhere even indirectly, then the developer who made it
                    is
                    professional
